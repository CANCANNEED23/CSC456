Chengshui Zhu Project Name: Task Manager

Description: This web application will record, list, and track activities users have entered. It is to solve the problem of people forgetting what needs to be done, what need to be finished first, and what had been done already. It's to help user handle mutiple situations and responsiblities in life. 

User: The primary user would be people who is having to much on their plate in their life and need to organize their tasks in order and priority. Example of these user could be college students, who have different classes, family duties, internship/jobs, relationship, and other stuff in their life, so being able to quickly record and list out tasks and get reminded later would be helpful.
